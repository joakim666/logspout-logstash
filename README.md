# logspout-logstash

Modified by me in this fork to passthrough log messages already in JSON format with the docker specific fields added. 

Without this change log messages already in JSON format will be passed along as new JSON objects with the original 
JSON-log message as escaped JSON in the 'message' field.


A minimalistic adapter for github.com/gliderlabs/logspout to write to Logstash UDP

Follow the instructions in https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/custom on how to build your own Logspout container with custom modules. Basically just copy the contents of the custom folder and include:

```
import (
  _ "github.com/looplab/logspout-logstash"
  _ "github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/transports/udp"
)
```

in modules.go.

Use by setting `ROUTE_URIS=logstash://host:port` to the Logstash host and port for UDP.

In your logstash config, set the input codec to `json` e.g:

input {
  udp {
    port => 5000
    codec => json
  }
}
